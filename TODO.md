## TODO

- [ ] Add effective logging.
- [ ] Add better config process.
- [ ] Refacto and use fastAPI instead (to benefit async calls).
- [ ] Migrate to mongoDB storage (for json_maps).
- [ ] Add Dockerfile to the project.
- [ ] Add an id for each upload to follow/link [identify] a user (ip address or something like that at least).
- [ ] write a backup system for those file-maps.
- [ ] Add accounts on it (using signIn with Telegram)
    - [ ] this may allow for not providing chat-id each times
    - [ ] this will help users to have a tracability on what have been sent through the service.
- [ ] Make the cleaner a whole independant system running async
